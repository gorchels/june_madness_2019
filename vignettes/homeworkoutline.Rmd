```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1) At least two different functions that summarize climate data in some way (your choice - it could be finding a trend, or finding extremes; or even simply mean winter precipitation)

  - 

2) At least two functions that calculate some measure of impact (you can really make these us) -so for example you could create a function that computes a heat stress index based on air temperature with parameters that vary with for different species; or a function that estimates water supply from precipitation with parameters that vary to reflect water storage â€¦you can make something up just as long as its somewhat sensible

3) One function that estimates the costs of impacts

4) Use multi-dimensional arrays in one of your functions

The package should contain:

some sample data
documentation for ALL functions
a vignette that shows how to use several of the functions with the sample data
3 separate tests - (next weeks lecture)
